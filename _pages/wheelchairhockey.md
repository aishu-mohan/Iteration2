Electric wheelchair hockey is a modified version of ice hockey for electric wheelchair users. It is commonly known as “Power hockey”. The sport is played on an indoor basketball court rather than an ice rink. There are two teams of five players.
<h3>Facts</h3>
<h3>
					Rules</h3>
Electric wheelchair hockey follows traditional ice hockey rules. However, it is modified to enable play by wheelchair athletes. It is played on a wooden surface instead of ice. A plastic ball is used instead of a hockey puck. Players use plastic T-shaped hockey sticks to hit the ball. The stick is held and operated by the player if their functionality permits this movement. Players with very limited range and movement can tape the stick to their wheelchair. Players are allocated one of five positions:
Centre
Goaltender
Left Winger
Right Winger
Defencemen
They can alternate positions during the game, provided there are five players on court at all times.
The objective is to score a goal by hitting the ball across the opposition’s goal line. The game is won by the team who scores the most goals.
