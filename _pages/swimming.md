					Rules
				</h3>
								<p>Para-swimmers follow slightly modified rules of mainstream swimming.  Athletes perform the standard stroke/s of their disciplines (Freestyle, Backstroke, Butterfly, Breastroke and Medley events, to the best of their ability. In able-bodied swimming, the race starts by competitors diving into the pool at the sound of a gun. If possible para-swimmers dive from the standing position. However, concessions are made and they can dive from a seated platform or start in the water. 
The regulation attire is a bathing suit. Like able-bodied swimming, athletes are forbidden to use any equipment that may enhance speed, buoyancy and endurance. </p>
