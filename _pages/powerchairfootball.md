Powerchair football is a modified version of soccer for electric wheelchair users. It is played in a gymnasium on a regulation basketball court. There are two teams of four players (including the goal keeper). The objective is to score more goals than the opposing team.
<h3>Facts</h3>
<h3>
					Rules</h3>
Powerchair football is played in specialised electric wheelchairs, called powerchairs. Each powerchair must have 4 or more wheels, a lap belt and a foot guard. The players use the foot guard to kick and block an over-sized soccer ball (33 cm in diameter).
A goal is scored when the ball fully enters the opposition’s goal area. The game is won by the team who scores the most goals.
There are four players on each team, including the goalkeeper. The 40 minute game is split into 20 minute halves, with a 10 minute half time break. The game is similar to able-bodied soccer. However powerchair football has two distinguishing rules:
<b>Two-on-one:</b> Only one player from each team is allowed within 3 metres of the ball on court (except in the goal area). This means teammates have to spread out which enables better game flow.
<b>3-in-the-goal-area:</b> The defending team is only allowed 2 players in their own goal area.
The penalty for infracting either of these rules is loss of possession and or/ a free kick-in from the sideline for the opposition. Able-bodied soccer has penalty “throw-ins”. However “kick-ins” are used in powerchair football because many players have impaired upper body function.
